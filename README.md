# CJK_MongoDB_2

Taking the time to teach myself how to connect a very basic REACT App which extracts data from a MongoDB. I've never used a noSQL database before and never created a backend server which the front end talks to using CORS.

Completing this I have learnt about NVM, CORS, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, REACT, Axios, and how to connect them all together.

âœ¨âœ¨Self learning is hard but very rewarding when you succeedâœ¨âœ¨

Next step - carry on learning ðŸ˜€

- Learn how add data
- Learn how to patch data
- Learn how to delete data
- Make the front end look better (I'm focussed on the learning rather than presentation for now)
